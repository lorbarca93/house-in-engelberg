  "_comment": "Engelberg Property Investment - Base Case Assumptions",
  "_description": "This file contains all assumption parameters used across all analyses. This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for all financial modeling assumptions.",
  "_calibration_note": "All assumptions are calibrated to real Engelberg Airbnb market data: 63% average occupancy, 200 CHF average nightly rate, approximately 46,000 CHF annual revenue. These values are based on actual performance data from comparable properties in Engelberg, Switzerland.",

  "financing": {
    "_explanation": "Financing assumptions reflect current Swiss mortgage market conditions and typical co-ownership investment structures. The 75% LTV is standard for investment properties in Switzerland, allowing for reasonable leverage while maintaining equity buffer.",

    "purchase_price": 1300000.0,
    "_purchase_price_explanation": "Market value based on comparable properties in Engelberg. Engelberg is a premium mountain resort destination at the foot of Mount Titlis, with strong property values due to tourism demand and limited supply. This price reflects a typical 3-4 bedroom property suitable for vacation rental.",

    "ltv": 0.75,
    "_ltv_explanation": "75% loan-to-value ratio is standard for investment properties in Switzerland. This provides 25% equity buffer, which is typical for rental property investments. Higher LTV would increase leverage but also risk, while lower LTV would require more equity upfront.",

    "interest_rate": 0.013,
    "_interest_rate_explanation": "1.3% annual interest rate reflects current Swiss mortgage market conditions (as of 2025). Swiss interest rates are historically low compared to other markets. This is a fixed-rate assumption for the base case, though rates may vary and need to be rolled periodically.",

    "amortization_rate": 0.01,
    "_amortization_explanation": "1% annual amortization on the initial loan amount is standard for Swiss mortgages. This means the loan balance decreases by 1% of the original loan amount each year. Over 15 years, this results in significant principal paydown, improving cash flow over time.",

    "num_owners": 4,
    "_num_owners_explanation": "Four co-owners is a practical number for managing a vacation property. It balances personal use (5 nights per owner = 20 total nights) with rental income potential. More owners would reduce equity per person but also reduce individual cash flow requirements. Fewer owners would increase equity requirements per person."
  },

  "rental": {
    "_explanation": "Rental assumptions are calibrated to real Engelberg Airbnb analytics data. Engelberg experiences strong seasonal variation with peak demand during ski season (winter) and hiking season (summer), with lower demand during shoulder seasons.",

    "owner_nights_per_person": 5,
    "_owner_nights_explanation": "Five nights per owner per year provides meaningful personal use while maximizing rental income. This is distributed across seasons (8 winter, 7 summer, 5 off-peak) to align with peak demand periods. More owner nights would reduce rental income, fewer would increase income but reduce personal value.",

    "days_per_year": 365,
    "_days_per_year_explanation": "Standard calendar year. The property is available for rental 365 days minus owner nights.",

    "legacy_occupancy_rate": 0.7,
    "_legacy_occupancy_explanation": "70% overall occupancy (updated) aligned to manager guidance; seasonals below apply per season.",

    "legacy_average_daily_rate": 200.0,
    "_legacy_adr_explanation": "200 CHF average daily rate is calibrated to actual Engelberg Airbnb market data. This is the weighted average across all seasons. Premium rates during ski season (250 CHF) and moderate rates in summer (200 CHF) average to approximately 200 CHF overall. This is a legacy parameter - actual rates vary by season as defined below.",

    "owner_nights_distribution": {
      "_explanation": "Owner nights are distributed across seasons to align with peak demand periods. More owner nights are allocated to winter and summer when rental demand is highest, maximizing rental income during peak periods.",
      "winter": 8,
      "_winter_nights_explanation": "8 owner nights during winter peak (Dec-Mar) when ski season demand is highest and rates are premium. Owners get priority during this high-value period.",
      "summer": 7,
      "_summer_nights_explanation": "7 owner nights during summer peak (Jun-Sep) when hiking and mountain activities drive strong demand. Good balance between personal use and rental income.",
      "offpeak": 5,
      "_offpeak_nights_explanation": "5 owner nights during off-peak shoulder seasons (Apr-May, Oct-Nov) when demand is lower. Minimizes impact on rental income during lower-demand periods."

This covers property insurance, liability insurance, and rental interruption insurance. Insurance costs in Switzerland typically range from 0.3-0.5% of property value for vacation rentals.",

    "nubbing_costs_annual": 2000.0,
    "_nubbing_costs_explanation": "2,000 CHF annually for nubbing costs (shared expenses for shared parts like water and heating in multi-unit buildings). This is typical for properties in shared buildings in Switzerland. These are fixed costs for common areas and shared utilities.",

    "electricity_internet_annual": 1000.0,

This covers both utilities and is based on typical consumption for a 3-4 bedroom vacation rental property.",

    "maintenance_rate": 0.005,
    "_maintenance_rate_explanation": "0.5% of property value annually for maintenance reserve is realistic for a newer property in good condition.

    "inflation_rate": 0.01,
